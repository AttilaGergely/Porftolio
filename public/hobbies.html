    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I am a pretty simple guy, that enjoys basically anything. I just need to experience
        all the adventures and memories with someone. I dont like solo "adventures"
        . IÂ´m a guitar player for almost 18years now. I have a very good hearing for music.
        I love to entertain people and I never let anyone feel bad, sad or alone. Im the guy
        that poeple call when they need emotional support. 
        I love to do sports of any kind (football, basketball, volleyball), but mostly 
        skiing and hiking. Nature is a very important part of my life and I love it.
        I also love to travel and try to enjoy every second of my life.
