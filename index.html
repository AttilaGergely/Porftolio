    <hr>
    <p>My name is Attila Gergely and im a third year student on the faculty of eletronics
        and informatics. I love to be in the center of attention and be in groups of people.
        I love to manage and lead teams in any way. I started an Udemy course with Angela
        to start focusing on my possible furute carreer in WebDevelopement.
        In shchool I have already passed WebDev but i decided to go through it from 
        the start again.

    <h2>My Education:</h2>
    <p>I have studied on a hungarian elementary school in the center of Bratislava. 
        During my studies here I also finished a music school where I learned how to
        play on guitar and learnt about musical theory for nine years.
        From there I moved to a middle school that focused on proigramming and electronics.
        I graduated and got extra certificates(CCNA1 and Linux). 
        Since I started studying programming I decided to continue with this field on college too.
        If everything goes right I will finish my degree this year and hopefully I will be able
        to find my future carreer in this field :) .
